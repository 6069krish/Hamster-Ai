The Hamster AI is a chatbot designed to interact with users through text or voice input.
It uses a JSON file to store predefined questions and answers. Upon receiving a query, 
the chatbot compares it with existing questions and suggests answers if there's a match.
If the question is new, the chatbot prompts the user to provide an answer and stores it in the JSON file for future reference.
This process enables the chatbot to learn and improve its responses over time. With SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries,
it supports voice input and output, enhancing user experience. This iterative learning approach fosters continuous improvement and adaptability.
